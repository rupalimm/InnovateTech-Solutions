Additionally, the rise in DIY outdoor projects is creating significant opportunities for market expansion. With outdoor sinks being a practical necessity for cleaning and washing in outdoor settings, the demand across North America, Europe, and the Asia Pacific region is expected to continue growing in the forecasted period.
