<p><h2>North America Pet Jerky Treat Market Drivers and Trends</h2><p>The growing demand for high-quality, protein-rich pet treats in North America is a key driver of the pet jerky treat market. Pet owners are increasingly seeking healthier alternatives to traditional snacks, leading to a shift towards jerky products made from natural ingredients such as chicken, beef, and turkey. The trend of humanization of pets, where pets are treated like family members, is pushing the demand for premium, nutritious products. Additionally, the increasing awareness of the benefits of natural pet food and treats has resulted in a preference for jerky options with minimal preservatives and additives.</p><p>Another significant driver is the rising trend of online pet product sales, which has facilitated easier access to a wide variety of pet jerky treats. With the growing convenience of e-commerce platforms, pet owners are more inclined to purchase jerky treats for their pets from the comfort of their homes. The demand for convenience, coupled with the increasing use of subscription services for pet food and treats, is further driving the market.
